    <h2>Dulce De Leche</h2>
    <p>Dulce De Leche is a rich, sweet confection made by slowly cooking milk and sugar until it thickens into a thick,creamy, caramel-like sauce with a deep, cooked-milk flavor. A staple in the Latin American cuisine and other parts of the world, this versatile spread or topping is used in desserts like cakes, pastries and ice cream.</p>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the can. Peel all labels off one or more cans of sweetened condensed milk.</li>
        <li>Place the unopened cans in a large pot. Fill the pot with water, ensuring the cans are covered by at least 1-2 inches of water.</li>
        <li>Bring the water to boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook for to 2-3 hours, depending on your desired color and thickness.</li>
        <li>Check the pot frequently (every 20-30 minutes) and add more hot water as needed to keep cans fully submerged.</li>
        <li>Remove the cans from the hot water with tongs and allow them to cool completly before opening. This can take several hours.</li>
        <li>Lastly, open the can, stir until smooth and transfer the dulce de leche to a jar or airtight container. It will last about 2 weeks in the fridge.</li>
